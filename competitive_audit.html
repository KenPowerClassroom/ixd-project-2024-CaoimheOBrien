      <th class = "Question"><i>Engagement: </i>How engaging is the app? Is it visually appealing? Does it have sound and animation to
        capture the user's attention? Does it have a good balance of challenge and reward?</th>
      <td id = "Great"> Kahoot! is an especially engaging in its use of gamification elements such as streaks and rewards to create 
        a competitive enviroment for the quizes. The app has a colourful interface as well as a memorable jingle. The multi-device 
        interface allows for multi-player game which allows for students/ players to play each other and help them to gain knowledge in 
        their chosen topic.  7/10
      </td>
      <td id = "Great"> The Typing.com interface is clean and has light colours to create an almost futuristic atmosphere which 
        allows the user to engage well with the program. It is easy to navigate and intuitive and this is further proven by its use of 
        gamification elements such as badges, streaks and points to create a competitive enviroment and motvie the users. 8/10 
      </td>
      <td id = "Mid">I think that Khan Academy is quite interactive and engaging because it uses various gamification elements such as
         badges and points. The app has a consitent colour theme and there isn't a lot of noise on the home screen. There isn't much to comment 
         on as it is quite simple.  6/10

      <th class = "Question"> <i>Progress tracking:</i>How well does the app track the user's progress? Does it provide feedback and 
        recommendations to help users improve their performance? Does it use data to personalize the learning experience?
      </th>
      <td id = "Mid">Kahoot! has a great feedback loop as the app let's you know if you have chosen the right/ wrong answer immediately after
         each question. It also shows you your points in comaprison to the others playing you're playing against. There is also a streak and 
         the screen displays who has the longest streak. However, the app does not keep your progress or points for more than one session. 
         6/10
      </td>
      <td id = "Great">Typing.com has a comprehensie progess tracking system. It tells you what levels and letters that you have mastered 
         what ones you have left to do. When completing the lessons, it gives you immediate feedback and provides personalised suggestions for 
         the letters and letter combinations taht you are weakest in. 9/10
      </td>
      <td id = "Great">Khan Academy has a good progress tracking system as it allows you to see what assignments you have yet to complete and 
        allows you to see all the assignments that oyu have completed so far. Whilst you are doing th eassignments, you are able to track your
        progress via the list of assignments; assignments that you have completed are marked with a greeen tick and shows you how well you have
        completeed each part of the assignment (i.e., the quizes show how many questions you got correct). Overall the Khan Academy ahs a good
        progress tracking system however, it does not generate any meaningful personalised feedback. 8/10

      <th class = "Question"><i>User experience:</i> How user-friendly is the app? Is it easy to navigate and use? Does it have clear 
        instructions and prompts? Does it have a well-designed interface?</th>
      <td id = "Great">The Kahoot, while the home page is bright, is also very noisy and the buttons to actaully create a quiz or a join a game are 
        hidden in the corner making it harder to engage with. The home page is filled with ads for different packages that the page offers which 
        I feel hinders the user engagement. When actually in a game however, the interface is quite simple and intuitive with almost no training 
        or instructions needed to figure out the gameplay. 7/10</td>
      <td id = "Great">The interface of this website is very minimalistic and clean. It is easy to maneuver and quite intuitive.The prompts are simple 
        and comprehendible. The lessons are easily accessible and organised well in folders/ sub-folders which keep the interface clean. They are 
        well-structured and keep the user engaged by increasing difficulty each lesson. 10/10 </td>
      <td id = "Great">The interface of Khan Academy is very similar to typing.com in the sense that it was minimalistic and clean.  The exercises are 
        well-structure and easy to find. The prompts are informative adn simple. 8/10 </td>
